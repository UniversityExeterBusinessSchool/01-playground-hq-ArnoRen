# My Structure - Student 9

## What I See in My Data
4 O spaced out, spacing 2 units, type is scattered path and block colour should be green and count 4

## What I Think This Means
4 O spaced out meaning 4 not long or short but near round/square shaped,
color = green means lego blocks will be green,
count 4 means 4 blocks,
spacing=2 meaning 2 lego head unit space between two,
type = scattered path is what it should look like

## What This Could Be

## Questions I Have
Is the unit is lego head/screw or similar width blocks (2 lego head spacing or 2 blocks that are like our blocks spacing)
